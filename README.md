# Optimize Recommendation

## Goal
This project build recommendation system to recommend the sequence of learning class units and partners that students could cooperate with in the class. The recommendation is based on a survey that asks about students perception on difficulty and interest of each unit. The purpose is to build a system that enables personalized study and make study recommendation specific to each student based on their interest and perception of difficulty of the units. The recommender is based on a type of collaborative filter. 
1) The recommendation system will suggest which unit a student should learn next. 
2) The recommendation system will suggest two classmates that a student can partner with in the class.
